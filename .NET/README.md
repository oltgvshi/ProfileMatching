# JobMatch - a Profile Matching System

JobMatch is an innovative school coding project that is designed to facilitate the process of finding suitable job opportunities for freelancers and clients. The project is built using ASP .NET CORE 6 MVC, which ensures that the website is fast, efficient and secure.

As a user of the JobMatch website, you can create a profile as a freelancer or client, and then proceed to post jobs or apply for them. Freelancers can select their category of work, such as web development, graphic design or writing, and clients can specify the category they are looking for in their job posts.

The project features a robust matching system that matches job posts with freelancers based on their category of work. This ensures that clients get access to the most qualified and suitable candidates for their projects, while freelancers can apply to jobs that match their skills and interests.
